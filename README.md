This repo hosts the code and paper written for my final data mining project. The project is an analysis of cartographic variables for the prediction of forest cover type from the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction. 

The code was originally written in Kaggle Kernel and is being uploaded to GitHub for the purpose of showing past work. The project was a collaborative effort between Chandler Stewart, Mai Pham, and Aryan Raja.
